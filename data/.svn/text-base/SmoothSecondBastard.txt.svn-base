smooth
you're a smooth second bastard, aren't you?
you from around here?
no? no.
something different about you
those clothes you wear, the way you talk
you're either from here or your not
from here means being here means coming into being
here means being born (no, not even born again) here; can't move in, or marry in
or fuck your way in.
second
where you from?
always, the long drive home
moving up out of the lushness of the Sacramento valley
into the dry, baking scrub-brushed foothills
further still, down and then up the river valleys: south fork middle fork north fork
of the Yuba, pine marching resolutely alongside, their green
smell full in my nose...
the dryness is perhaps what is most difficult in remembering the place.

some text
a text
some words, known
a story lies amongst the curves and lines
waiting to be told
i grow old
i grow singular or plural?
the choices change, as I make them.
highly adaptive, highly critical, but still left
lying betwixt and between.
